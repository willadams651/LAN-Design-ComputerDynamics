## üìò Overview

This project provides a comprehensive Local Area Network (LAN) design proposal for a fictional company called *Computer Dynamics*. The objective is to develop a secure, scalable, and high-speed campus-wide network infrastructure using a **physical star topology**, **Ethernet cabling**, and **fiber optic backbones** between buildings.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**  
- **Star Topology Network Design**  
- **Ethernet and UTP Cabling**  
- **Fiber Optic Backbone**  
- **Switched Network Architecture**  
- **Wireless Access Point Deployment**  
- **Campus-Wide Networking**

## üè¢ Project Description

The design features:

- A **physical star topology** using UTP cabling to connect computers to switches on every floor.
- A **multi-mode fiber optic backbone** connecting three buildings, with one serving as the central hub.
- Each floor has a local LAN and connects to the building‚Äôs main switch.
- Switches from each building link to the **main router** through fiber connections.
- **Wireless networks** are supported by deploying access points on each floor.
- Network switches are **Ethernet-based**, ensuring efficient traffic management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Assumptions

- Each workstation is equipped with an Ethernet port.
- Fiber optic cables are used for **inter-building connectivity** for high-speed data transfer.
- A dedicated **network management system** is assumed to be in place.
- Internet access hardware will be selected based on the **network manager‚Äôs preference**.
- The design does **not include a WAN**, as the network is contained within a single campus.

---

## üîê Security and Management

- Assumes appropriate network **security software** and configurations.
- Budget-based flexibility for future **hardware and software scaling**.
- Centralized control through **main switches and router**.
